# [OBSOLETE] How to use a custom theme assembly

## This example is dedicated to an obsolete approach. If your DevExpress version is newer than 12.1, we recommend the solution from the [Attaching a Custom Theme Assembly](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/16728/common-concepts/appearance-customization-theming/attaching-a-custom-theme-assembly) article

<p>This solution contains two projects. The "MyThemeAssembly" project is a class library that generates the custom theme assembly. This assembly is added to the Bin folder of the second project, which is an ASP.NET Web Forms WebSite.</p>
